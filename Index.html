        <p class="text"> As billions of metric tons of CO2 are released into the air we breathe each year, 
        have you ever wondered how our bodies might be affected? In this data-driven exploration, 
        I delve into the correlation between rising CO2 emissions, pollution levels, 
        and their potential impact on lung cancer diagnosis rates across different regions of the USA. </p>

    <div class = "data1Div" id = "data1Div">
            <p class="text" id = "data1Text"> To view the relationship between CO2 and lung cancer, let us look at two states, Arkansas and Utah. <p>

    <div class = "data2Div" id = "data2Div">
            <p class="text" id = 'data2Text'> Well, maybe a different example would show a correlation, so let's look at California and New Mexico. </p>

            <p class="text" id = 'data3Text'> These are only two examples, maybe seeing the whole graph will tell us more.</p>

    <div class = "conclusionDiv" id = "conclusionDiv">
        <p class="text"> While the analysis shows no sign of a correlation between the amount of CO2 a state produces and lung cancer cases, 
        many other factors could influence the relationship. Investigating this relationship's social and environmental factors could 
        show a nuanced relationship between CO2 and lung cancer. </p>
